## 📌 Overview

An **end-to-end Machine Learning system** for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time.

Built with a **production-first mindset**, this project integrates:

* ✅ Machine Learning (XGBoost)
* ✅ FastAPI for real-time predictions
* ✅ Docker for deployment
* ✅ Logging & Monitoring (MLOps)
* ✅ Threshold-based risk scoring

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Fraud detection is a **high-risk, high-impact problem**:

* Fraud cases are **extremely rare (~0.17%)**
* Dataset is **highly imbalanced**
* Missing fraud (**False Negative**) is very costly

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach

Instead of optimizing for accuracy, this system focuses on:

* 🔥 **High Recall (Fraud Detection Priority)**
* 📉 **PR-AUC over Accuracy**
* ⚖️ **Class Imbalance Handling (SMOTE)**
* 🎯 **Custom Threshold Optimization**

---

## 📊 Dataset

* 📦 Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset
* 🔢 Transactions: ~284,000
* 🚨 Fraud Cases: ~492

### Key Features:

* `V1–V28`: PCA-transformed features
* `Amount`: Only interpretable feature
* No missing values

---

## 🔍 EDA Insights

* Severe class imbalance (<1% fraud)
* Amount distribution is highly skewed
* PCA removes multicollinearity

---

## ⚙️ Model Selection

### 🚀 XGBoost

Why XGBoost?

* Handles **imbalanced data effectively**
* Captures **non-linear patterns**
* Strong performance on tabular data
* Built-in regularization

---

## ⚖️ Handling Imbalance

### ✅ SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling)

* Generates synthetic fraud samples
* Avoids data loss (better than undersampling)

---

## 🎯 Threshold Optimization (Key Innovation)

### ❌ Default (0.5)

* Misses fraud cases

### ✅ Custom Threshold (~0.03)

* Maximizes **Recall (~91%)**

💡 **Business Insight:**

> Missing fraud is more expensive than false positives.

## 📈 Model Performance

| Metric    | Value                      |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| ROC-AUC   | ~0.98                      |
| PR-AUC    | ~0.87                      |
| Recall    | ~0.91                      |
| Precision | Lower (expected trade-off) |

  "V2": -0.07,
  "V3": 2.53,
  "V4": 1.37,
  "Amount": 149.62
}
```

### 🔹 Output

```json
{
  "fraud": false,
  "probability": 0.03,
  "threshold_used": 0.034,
  "risk_level": "SAFE",
  "message": "Safe Transaction ✅"
}
```

## 📊 Logging & Monitoring

* Predictions stored in:

```
logs/predictions.csv
```

### Why this matters:

* 📈 Monitor model performance
* 🔍 Debug incorrect predictions
* 🔄 Use data for retraining
* ⚠️ Detect data drift

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* Dataset not included (size constraints)
* Model files included for inference
* Logs excluded via `.gitignore`

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* Handling **imbalanced datasets**
* Importance of **PR-AUC**
